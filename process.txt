well first of all,
I...have to tell you about the problem that occurs on this company.
since I was a kid, I always hears my father's complaining while doing the paper work,
like is this guy really work this much,
is this the right amount of money that they took from the advance salary.

anddd on this suspicion and assumption that there is an incorrect data in the system.
whether it happen by intentionaly misinformation by the employee or a human error.
you know the thing ah the time card that used to stored the amout of work of employee
is writen by hand of the supervisor. and the only thing that can prove it authenticity is
the signature or hand writing signature.
so from that point I've tried to make a model to detect these anomally information

**********************************************************************************
... ohh right!how can I not see this! Thank you! thank you!
I will try this!why cant i not see this..why cant i not see this..why cant i not see this
you know I probaly can use the deep learning algorithm with this...
*******************************************************************************************

first of all we need a data to create the model right?
so I used the some of existing data on the database (and I'm the one who made this database
you know my father been using microsoft excel for like 20 years and he never doing it right,
like ... he doesn't use the advantage of column, to seperate the data. so I've made the
database and move all the data to it, and a web application in order to help my father
input the data or getting an information.
yeah but when I shown him and teach him how to use it like you need to enter the password here
use this form to enther the data
and he was like this is so unnessessery and too complicated I can remember everything
about my employee. and I was like may be im wrong he's been using excel for like 20 years
he not gonna change the way he work. and he also said something like. This work need to be
touch by human)
ok get back to the main project
we need the data to create the model right?

so I get the data from the database and create a new one by going through the employee
documents like visa working permit and also directly ask the employee for some missing data or new data

and when i got all of this data. we can not use it yet.
we need to prepare it first. in this process you can think of when you are cook a chicken
and you got a chicken "a real chicken" you know the one that still have a feather on it.
so you need to get the only eadible part of the chicken.
so for the data.
it's will be like remove an unnecessery column, filling missing data. convert some text column
into number. and doing the preprocessing like zero mean to make it easier for computation.

next we are going to choose which algorithm that we want to use in our model.
and there is a lot of machine learning algorithm out there.
you can think of machine learning algorithm as a black box .
and you tell it what information you want it to predict.
then you input your data into the box and wait for the awnser.
and you can also also config this box to make it better.
and which one are we going choose. which one is the best for our data?
we don't know...
we have to try all of it or as many as you can.
for this project I start by a using a classification algorithm like SVM, nearest neighbor, decision tree
it work like, you have a table of your data and you hide one of the column. the classification algorithm
will try to predict that** and then we use the data that it has predicted compare with the data that
we hide from before. and check how many it's right or wrong. this is call accuracy.
and in this project the accuracy of classsification algorithm is not very good.
i assume that data is suitable with this type of algorithm. may be it's not catagorical.
it should be fine when predict is this a dog or a cat.

then I tried the regression algorithm. which unsurprisingly not accurate at all.
because the regression is good for continuous data like ah stock price.

now two main algorithm is not working with the data this is not looking good
I even tried it with neural netwok you know the deep learning algorithm
still not working

so the last one the clustering algorithm.
here is how it work the clustering algorithm will try define a group of data that has a similar pattern
and that is something I think I can use to create the model.
because I also have an assumption that worker the employee can be devided into a group of similar work patern.
and  If there is an incorrect data in the system it will not likely fall into any of this group.
for example like every employee has worked around 30 hours this week but you have 35 hours. you can see
the data is standing out.
that is why I decided to use clustering algorithm.




so how can we  CREATE the prediction model using clustering algorithm.
the first problme is how many group should there be?
well because there is alot of features in the data that we are going to use to create the model
you can think of features as a dimention.
ah If you look at figure number 2 you can see that I used only two features to plot the graph
and you can tell right away how the data is group together by using your eyes.
but what what if we add another feature? the data is going to look like figure number 3
it's now 3 dimensions. you may can still see how the data is group together.
but what if we add another dimention. it's now 4-dimention It can't even plot on the graph.
and the real data is even grater 4 dimentions.

so I have the algorithm called mean shift which will figure out how many cluster there there is. magic
not really. Do you want to know how it work.
now we have a rough Idea of how many cluster there is.

next we are going use kmeans algorithm to cluster the data.
and the reason why I used the kmeans insted of mean shift
because the cluster from k mean is more sphirical than mean shift and
I also want to create the out line of the data.
you can think of this hand is your data. and you want to make an outline of your hand
the meanshift will create a cluster on each of your finger
and If you use these cluster to create an outline to cover all of your data
it will be a circle like this which will cover alot of empty space. that we dont want
we want the empty space to me as low as possible
on the other hand if you use k-means and you specify how many cluster you want.
and the k mean will create a small cluster like on the tips of your fingger
anouther cluster maybe around here lower.
as you can see the out line will cover mostly finger and less empty space
you can see it's looking pretty good right.
and what if you make it smaller like on every cell of your finger it's will most likely have no empty space 
at all!
but unfortunately we can not do that. in machine learning it's called overfitting. the model will
have a poor accuracy whe predict the new data that it never seen before.

and now we are going to extract these outline from kmeans algorithm.
and ofcause like i said before we shouldn't use only one algorithm. 
I also use another algorithm like ward hierachical, DBSCAN spectral algoritm too
and combine these outline together.

and the model is finnished now how are we going to detect the anomally data.
we just mesure the distant using euclidient distant from the data to the nearest center to the centroid.
the centroid is the center of the cluster. combine with the threshold that we define.
so as a result the longer the distant is the higher possibility it is that the data will be incorrect.




''''
the other thing like image processing
you know like ah
When the worker go back to their country (may be for vacation reason something like this)
And when I asks them for their document for the paper work in thailand.
like picture, resident certification. which they will use their phone and take the picture.
which usesually in a very low quality. beary readable
so I tried to make it better using both of the photoshop and Image processing. thresholding method
where you fillter some of the pixel. well ofcause this feature is in photoshop too.
But I just want to create my own. and some like adaptive guassian thresholding is not available in photoshop.
